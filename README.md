# fritzbox-communication
A Rust-library that can be used to communicate with the FRITZ!Box API (WIP).

Used as part of: https://github.com/adeveloper-wq/home-telegram-bot

Currently this is only a Rust-learning-project for me. Therefore this don't really has a lot features/is maintained/being developed further.
Maybe in the future I'm coming back to this to expand the functionality.
